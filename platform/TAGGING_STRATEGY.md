# Tagging strategy

As with many practices in operations, implementing a tagging strategy is a process of iteration and improvement. Start small with your immediate priority and grow the tagging schema as you need to.

Main focus of our tagging strategy is FinOps and Security, with that proposed strategy described with main focus on that two aspects.

There are several types of workloads considered:

1. One workload, one service
2. One workload, many services
3. Many workload, with one or many services

Assumptions:

1. One EKS for all workloads.

## FinOps

Map spending data to the business
- Meaningful taxonomy of your costs
- Organizational breakdown (by division, business unit, management hierarchy)
- Functional Breakdown (by workload)
- By cost center, service ID, or other identifier (map to available taxonomy)

Set tag strategy and compliance
- How to handle Untagged, Untaggable spending
- How to handle tag compliance

## SecOps

When breaches or other security problems happen, it’s important to classify the data and figure out how it affects security. Tagging opens the door to more secure operations.

- Workload owner name
- Operations team / Team that is accountable for day-to-day operations
- Business criticality / Business impact of the resource or supported workload
- Disaster recovery / Business criticality of the workload or service
- End date of the project / Date when the workload is scheduled for retirement
