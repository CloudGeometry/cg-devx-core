### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report.
Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you
are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information
it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and
> include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug

* **Determine which components of the platform cause problem**
* **Check the FAQs, git pages and forums of those components to identify if the problem is with component itself**
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/CloudGeometry/cgdevx-core/issues)** to see if the problem has already
  been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide the
following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/paste
  snippets, which you use. If you're providing snippets in the issue,
  use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines)
  and [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that
  behavior
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version(s) of packages) or was this always
  a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version?** What's the most
  recent version in which the problem does not happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which
  conditions it normally happens

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor
improvements. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you
might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion,

in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're
requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check if enhancement is implemented in existing component of pipeline or there is an existing component with
  desired functionality**
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/CloudGeometry/cgdevx-core/issues)** to see if the enhancement has
  already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?
