# Welcome to CG DevX

Here, at CloudGeometry, we use CG DevX as a Reference Architecture for simplifying the creation and management of DevOps
and Cloud resources, and we've decided to make it available to the public.

While we consider it to be pretty exciting, it's important that you realize that this public version is a pre-alpha
release; there's no guarantee that it will work for you, and it's very likely that things will change before the general
release.

## What is CG DevX?

CG DevX is an all-in-one platform designed to simplify and enhance the development, deployment, and management of
cloud-native applications. Whether you are an experienced platform engineer or just a beginner DevOps starting your
cloud-native journey, CG DevX provides the tools and capabilities to empower your team and streamline your workflows.

For comprehensive list of features please see
this [page](https://cloudgeometry.github.io/cg-devx-docs/capabilities/capabilities/).
