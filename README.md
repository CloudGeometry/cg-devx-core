# Welcome to CG DevX

**CG DevX** is an application delivery platform built with best in class open source tooling, used to simplify the 
challenges of modern cloud-native development. By integrating powerful tools like Kubernetes and Terraform, CG DevX 
reduces the manual effort often associated with managing microservices, containers, and CI/CD pipelines, so that 
developers need to worry less about tedious and error-prone tasks.

Designed for scalability and flexibility, CG DevX empowers teams to modernize their applications, automate processes,
and increase reliability – all without needing to overhaul their existing infrastructure or introduce unnecessary complexity.

### **Key Features**

* **Cloud-Native Ready**: Pre-packaged with Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform, CG DevX accelerates cloud-native adoption
  and simplifies the app delivery process.
* **Workload Management**: Out-of-the-box integration with Prometheus and Grafana for seamless observability and
  real-time performance metrics.
* **Modular & Flexible**: The platform’s modular design allows developers to integrate their existing tools while
  offering the adaptability needed for continuous improvement.
* **GitOps Integration**: Enables infrastructure automation using a Git-driven approach to increase operational consistency.

## Why CG DevX?

CG DevX is tailored for teams looking to streamline their application delivery workflows without getting bogged down 
in operational complexity. It frees developers from the burden of repetitive tasks and minimizes the risk of manual errors 
by providing:

* Automation to reduce the operational overhead involved in cloud-native deployments.
* Accelerated development cycles with pre-configured modules that help teams move faster.
* A community-driven, open-source foundation focused on delivering reliable, scalable, and secure application environments.
