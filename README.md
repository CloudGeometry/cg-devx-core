# Welcome to CG DevX

**CG DevX** is an open-source platform engineering toolkit designed to streamline cloud-native development and
operations. It integrates best-in-class tools like Kubernetes and Terraform, while simplifying the complexities of
microservices, containerization, and CI/CD processes.

Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, CG DevX empowers platform engineers and DevOps teams to modernize
applications with ease, automate workflows, and increase reliability without overhauling existing infrastructure.

### **Key Features**

* **Cloud-Native Ready**: Pre-configured with tools like Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform to accelerate cloud adoption.
* **Workload Management**: Provides seamless integration with Prometheus and Grafana, enhancing observability and
  operational metrics.
* **Modular & Flexible**: CG DevXâ€™s modular architecture allows developers to plug in existing DevOps tools, providing
  extensibility and adaptability.
* **GitOps Integration**: Enables infrastructure automation using a Git-driven approach to increase operational
  consistency.

## Why CG DevX?

CG DevX is designed to help developers and operations teams embrace platform engineering without the burden of managing
complex cloud-native workflows. With its open-source foundation, you can:

* Reduce the complexity of cloud operations with built-in automation and standardization.
* Speed up cloud-native transformations with pre-configured modules.
* Build on top of a community-driven framework that emphasizes agility, security, and continuous improvement.
