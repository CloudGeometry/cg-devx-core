# Welcome to CGDevX

Here ate CloudGeometry we use CGDevX to simplify the creation and management of DevOps and Cloud resources, and we've
decided to make it available to the public.

While we consider it to be pretty exciting, it's important that you realize that this public version is a pre-alpha
release; there's no guarantee that it will work for you, and it's very likely that things will change before the general
release.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the directions at [cgdevx-docs](CloudGeometry/cgdevx-docs).

## Contributing

Interested in contributing to CGDevX? We're always interested in hearing ideas. Please feel free to message us
at [cgdevx@cloudgeometry.io](mailto:cgdevx@cloudgeometry.io?subject=[GitHub]%20Contributing%20to%20CGDevX) or simply
create a pull request, and we'll be happy to look at it!

## Acknowledgements

In the spirit of open source, we build on the work of others, just as we expect others to build on the work we do. To
that end, we wanted to acknowledge the projects whose code is included in this release:
